## Summary [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mirek/node-json-criteria.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mirek/node-json-criteria)

## Installation

    npm install json-criteria --save

## Usage

Currently we're exposing single function `ev(doc, query)` which returns true on match and false otherwise.

    var ev = require('json-criteria').ev
    console.log(ev({ foo: bar: 123 }, { 'foo.bar': { $eq: 123 } })) # true
    console.log(ev({ foo: bar: 123 }, { 'foo.bar': { $lt: 100 } })) # false

For more examples have a look at specs.
